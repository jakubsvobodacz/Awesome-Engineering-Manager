# Engineering Manager Hub
The aim of this repository is to provide a curated list of resources for, begineer as well as seasoned, software engineering managers. The repository will contain links to all interesting resources within categories that are part of an engineering manager job. Contributions and feedback are welcomed!

Engineering Manager will be further addressed as *EM*.

## Role Definition
What is *really* is to be an Engineering Manager? What tasks does it involve and what are the boundaries of what you should or should not do? This is one of the questions that I have (and still am) asking myself. There is no only one and always followed definition of the role and it can vary greatly per organization. Therefore, the number one advice is to:

```When starting at a new organization, you should always seek a role definition for Engineering Mangager```

It could be in terms of main responsiblities, objectives, deliverables. Anything that will help you to naild down your role and that should become your mantra going forward for instance when deciding about whether you should join an architectural discussion with your team or not. In one organization this could be a main responsibility, in other, this would be too much of an intervention.

## Code Reviews
Code reviews are significant part of software development and neccessary safety break and learning for your team. They should be straight-forward but thorough and if not having the right setup, they might create fatigue or even conflict in the team.

## Recruitment
Hiring people into your team is probably the most crucial task on your engineering manager task list. Without the right people, nothing will move forward.

## Team Structure
Should you follow the Scrum to the point that everyone is an engineer/developer or should you have dedicated QAs, Architects etc. on your team?

## People Development
You need to make sure that you and your reports find together the *hyperdrive* that will keep them engaged and motivated in their career. We are all individuals and therefore this part of the job is very challenging as one approach might totally work for some while for others completely ineffective.

### Recommended Books
The following list of books are not a must read but a *very nice to read* and what I particularly find useful about them is how much to the practical point they all are. There is very little fluff and you mostly find practical and tangible examples or advices. I would also say that it does not matter whether you are an engineering manager already or you are aspiring to the role. However, reading it in paralel with your engineering manager role could be the most beneficial time of reading (as long as you have time for it).
